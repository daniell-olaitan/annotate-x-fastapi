# 🖍️ annotate-x-fastapi

**annotate-x-fastapi** is a full-stack web application that enables users to **annotate images with bounding boxes** and **export the labeled datasets in COCO format** — ideal for training computer vision models.

**NOTE**: The pattern (unit of work, repository and service layer patterns) used in this project is a bit verbose and an overkill for the current stage of the project. It was used for learning purpose and for probable future features for scalability and maintainability.

## 📌 Project Overview

**annotate-x-fastapi** is designed for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers who need to prepare datasets for object detection tasks. The app allows users to:

- Upload and annotate images using bounding boxes
- View and edit annotations
- Export labeled data in **COCO JSON** format
- Manage annotation sessions easily via a clean UI

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ Upload multiple images for annotation
- ✍️ Draw, resize, and move bounding boxes on each image
- 🧠 Label each annotation with a class name
- 📤 Export labeled datasets in **COCO format**
- 🔐 User-friendly and responsive interface
- 🐳 Dockerized for easy setup and deployment
